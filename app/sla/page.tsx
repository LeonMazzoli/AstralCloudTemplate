                  We are very confident in the reliability of the service we
                  provide with a proven track record of over 5 years. We
                  understand firsthand how crucial it is for an online service
                  to maintain high-availability, which is why we provide an SLA
                  (Service Level Agreement) to cover our clients in the event of
                  a service disruption. The following services of ours are
                  covered by this Service Level Agreement: Minecraft server
                  hosting, Minecraft Pocket Edition server hosting, TeamSpeak
                  server hosting.

                      our service does not maintain this agreement for 5

                    <li>
                      To receive service compensation, the client must create an
                      SLA claim via support ticket from their authorised client
                      account.

                      Any SLA claims we deem to be fraudulent will be rejected.

                    <li>
                      We reserve the right to deny SLA claims if we believe the
                      client has purposely attempted to cause a service
                      disruption to claim against our SLA (e.g: if we believe
                      the client was involved in initiating a denial of service
                      attack against their own service).
